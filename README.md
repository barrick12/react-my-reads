# MyReads Project

This is a Udacity project to practice using React. 

The app displays books the user may choose to categorize as "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", or "Read", from the search results. Books may be recategorized or dismissed on demand.

To install and run a development build, at the terminal type "npm install", and then "npm start".
